# TODO
- ~~fix coordinates (upper left is origin, simple translation (at render time?))~~
- ~~points, lines~~
- eventually, 3D

### hmm
- **either keep pixels private and only change thru set__() methods that translate thru the method**.
- ~~make pixels public and treat it as the normal transformation, and then transform on render~~
